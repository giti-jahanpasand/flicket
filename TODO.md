# Flicket Todo List

## High
* allow postee to delete existing uploaded images

## Medium
* lock tickets after x number of days?
* show if ticket contents were modified (edited replies are)
* implement database recorded logging system so changes to ticket content 'was > is'
is recorded for quality purposes.
* enhance the flicket admin section.
* Add a FlicketUser class which inherits properties from database object class. This will 
make implementing into existing applications easier?

## Low
* There seems to be a lot of dupilcated html in pages. There must be a 
better way?
* Put Flicket specific settings in database and make editable.
