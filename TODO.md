# Flicket Todo List

## High
* allow postee to delete existing uploaded images

## Medium
* lock tickets after x number of days?
* add function for admin to edit users passwords.
* show if ticket contents were modified (edited replies are)

## Low
* There seems to be a lot of dupilcated html in pages. There must be a 
better way?
* Tickets view - Make toggle form view state persistent over pages.
* Put Flicket specific settings in database and make editable.
